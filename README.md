## What is ansible?


Ansible is an open-source automation tool that simplifies configuration management, application deployment, and task automation through declarative scripts, called playbooks, without the need for agents on managed systems.

## What is cloudformation?

AWS CloudFormation is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables users to define and provision infrastructure as code (IaC) in a declarative manner. It allows the creation, modification, and deletion of AWS resources using templates written in JSON or YAML, providing a scalable and automated approach to managing cloud infrastructure.
